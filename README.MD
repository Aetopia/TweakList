TweakList is a PowerShell module aiming to regroup every impactful tweaks for fine tuning, stripping and optimizing Windows, each tweaks has it's own file **and can be put together as a "[TweakScript](https://gist.github.com/couleurm/68d272edc5fb930c31b96b667813e373 "TweakList example")"**

</br>

It aims to make common tuning easy, some stuff like:

* Common settings everyone ticks anyways
* Scripts to automatically find and tune game settings (e.g [Apex Legends](https://github.com/couleur-tweak-tips/utils/tree/main/Patchers/Apex%20Settings%20Patcher), will have something for Minecraft soon)
* Installation of programs using [scoop](http://scoop.sh), an UAC-less command line package manager for Windows
* Anything that can be automated/assisted via the Regedit/PowerShell/GPO/Batch

---


## üìùTweak Functions planned:

- Tune almost every Windows settings with slightly modified functions from Sophia Script
- Parse and merge game configs (e.g Minecraft, Apex Legends, Fortnite, Valorant ect..) without affecting settings that are personal preference
- Easily add prioritized processes via the registry (if that even impacts performance)
- Tune Xbox Game Mode/Bar/DVR & Hardware accelerated GPU scheduling
- Rewrite [nvidia-updater](https://github.com/lord-carlos/nvidia-update/blob/master/nvidia.ps1) ft. NVCleanstall
- Warn user is bloat is running (Synapse, iCue, OneDrive)
  Use [autorunsc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns#autorunsc-usage) to parse every programs that runs at startup
- Make combos that run multiple functions at once (e.g completly cleans the taskbar)
- Disabling defender / mitigations / spectre & meltdown (with warnings of course)
- Heavy stripping (with warnings of course)
- Quick ways to download & run the latest version of DDU/NVCleanstall

üí≠ *(This list will get longer as times goes on, this is what I remembered from the top of my head)*

## How TweakList works in the background:

- Each Tweak Function has it's own designated file, with a function declaration that has the exact same name as the file that hosts it
- At each commit, GitHub actions will add up the content of every single file into a Master script that holds the latest version of every Tweak Function
- Then people can open PowerShell and run the Master script, which will let the user be able to run every TweakList function, this can be used in a script (e.g your favorite e-sport player's tweaklist) or simply be typed from the command line

## I've borrowed some stuff (with permission), from these scripts/lists:

* [farag2](https://i.imgur.com/Vf1pthm.png)'s [Sophia Script](https://github.com/farag2/Sophia-Script-for-Windows), it contains 150+ functions for automating Windows' settings just right (perfect when you just installed Windows)
* [Zusier](https://i.imgur.com/hAL2wGf.png)'s [optimization batch](https://github.com/Zusier/Zusiers-optimization-Batch)
* [Melody](https://i.imgur.com/6nZSqh3.png)'s [Basic Tweaks list](https://sites.google.com/view/melodystweaks/basictweaks)
* [Major Geeks](https://i.imgur.com/fKbpDnl.png)' [Windows Registry Tweaks](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/majorgeeks_registry_tweaks.html), similar to Sophia Script, it also has a lot of .REGs to debloat the context menu (file right click menu)
